## Digital Product Management - Final Portfolio Repository

This is the repository for my final project for my Digital Product Management class in the spring of 2023 here at Iowa. Our goal was to create a website that functions as a personal portfolio, and acts as a culmination of everything we have learned in this class this semester.

I built this website from a bootstrap HTML template, and from there I edited the website content and modified the template to include information about my personal life, my skills and abilities, and my work and educational experiences. I also created a section specifically for my mechanical experience, which I have been wanting to do for awhile.

### Tools I used:
Throughout this project, I utilized source code management here with GitHub and feature branches in GitHub desktop. The bulk of this website is built with HTML, but there are also some Javascript elements, as well as some CSS styling in stylesheets. Some specific project requirements included the use of favicons and meta tags, and we utilized compliance tools like cookie popups, privacy policies, and terms of use. At the end of the site creation, we used Google Analytics to create a campaign to monitor website traffic and usage.
